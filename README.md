# Project name 
Sorting Hat

# Overview
The sorting hat app sorts any name of a new student at Hogwarts and gives that student an assigned "house" or designation within the institution. The form will appear once you click "Let's Start Sorting!" Then, when you enter the new student's name and hit "Sort!", a card will appear with that student's name and the house to which they are assigned. IF a name is not entered, a warning message will appear telling the user that a name must be entered. If a student is to be expelled, one can click on the "Expel" button, which deletes the card and dismisses the student from the school.
